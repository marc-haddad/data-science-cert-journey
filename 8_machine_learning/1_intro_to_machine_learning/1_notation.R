# In Machine Learning (ML) data comes in the form of
# outcomes (Y) we wish to predict, & the features (X_1...X_p) we will use to predict the outcome
# Features are also known as predictors, and covariates

# Types of prediction problems: categorical, & continous

# Categorical outcomes: Y can be any of K classes
  # Ex: K = 10, w/ classes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9
  # Ex: Speech recognission: outcomes are all possible words we're trying to detect

# notation of K: k = 1, ..., K, and k = 0, 1 (if binary)

# To predict an unknown outcome w/ features, we collect data for which we DO know the outcome

# Y_hat denotes prediction
# "Actual outcome" is used to denote what we ended up observing
# We want Y_hat == actual outcome

# ML task for categorical data is known as Classification,
# where predictions will be categorical like our outcomes,
# and they will be either right or wrong

# ML task for continuous data is known as Prediction,
# not measured as right or wrong,
# instead measured w/ ERROR, the diff b/w our prediction and actual outcome


# First step in writing ML algorithm:
  # What are the outcomes?
  # What are the features?
