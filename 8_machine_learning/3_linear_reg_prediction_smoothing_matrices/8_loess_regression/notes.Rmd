## Limitation of Bin Smoother Approach

\

A limitation of the earlier bin smoother approach (see previous notes) was that we were required to take very small windows for the approximately constant assumption to hold. This results in a small number of data points to average.

Local Weighted Regression (AKA Loess) permits us to consider larger windows and, thus, achieve more accurate, smoother trendlines.
